# go_http_server

This whole repo is a part of a project-course on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/50f37da8-72c0-4860-a7d1-17e4bda5c243)
The idea is to build a HTTP Server in Go without frameworks, to really get into how they work and so forth.

Goals of This Course

  - Understand what web servers are and how they power real-world web applications
  - Build a production-style HTTP server in Go, without the use of a framework
  - Use JSON, headers, and status codes to communicate with clients via a RESTful API
  - Learn what makes Go a great language for building fast web servers
  - Use type safe SQL to store and retrieve data from a Postgres database
  - Implement a secure authentication/authorization system with well-tested cryptography libraries
  - Build and understand webhooks and API keys
  - Document the REST API with markdown
